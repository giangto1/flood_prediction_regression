<h1> Predict Flood Probability </h1>
<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> Basing on 21 different various factors (Monsoon Intenseity, Deforestation, River Management, etc.), I created a linear regression model to predict the probability the region will be flooded. 
  The accuracy of the model (based on the R2 score) is improved from 79% to 84% after applying feature selection.  </p>
<h2> Output file </h2>
<p> The model is trained on train.csv and tested on test.csv. The final submission containing the flood predictions for the test data is in sample.csv</p>
